# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
# array_mod I used inject.  I tried using almost every differnt
# method available in the ruby docs and I worked on this for hours
# trying to figure out how to only modify the numbers without modifying
# the text.  Needless to say I finally stumbled upon inject.  The example
# I found only had a single arguement and produced a new array of just 
# the adjusted numbers without the text.  After reading the article a
# few times I understood that I needed only to add a line that passed
# the string values to the new array and a line that modified the numbers

#the hash mod was a relatively easy hash.each method that iterated
# over each key and changed the value accordingly.
